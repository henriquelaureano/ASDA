\Abstract{Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common diabetic eye disease and is
          the leading cause of new blindness among the diabetes patients. The exact
          technique by which diabetes causes this condition is unclear, and it can
          develop without any serious symptoms. Therefore, the early detection of
          this disease is crucial. This paper focuses on the analysis of the retina
          in the diabetes patients via a logistic linear regression model. Moreover,
          it aims to test the accuracy of the prediction by using this methodology
          with different link functions, to predict whether a particular person has
          a diabetic retinopathy signs disease or not. The data was taken from UCI
          repository [1], it contains features extracted from the Messidor (Methods
          to evaluate segmentation and indexing techniques in the field of retinal
          ophthalmology) image set to predict whether an image contains signs of
          diabetic retinopathy or not. In a preliminary analysis, we see that
          practically all the data (99.7\%) present a sufficient quality assessment
          and that more than 90\% of the patients present a Severe Retinal
          Abnormality (SRA). Looking marginally to the means among the groups
          (patients with and without signs of DR) of the features (1) Euclidian 
          distance of the center of the macula to the center of the optic disc and
          (2) the diameter of the optic disc, we see through a \(t\)-test that their
          means don't differ significantly, being in reality very closer. Fitting a
          logistic regression with all the features this same result was obtained.
          In a initial analysis the goodness of fit of the model was satisfactory,
          having almost all features related with Microaneurism Detection (MD) as
          significant. In the next steps a selection of variables will be made and
          others link funcions in the model will be tested. In the end, besides the
          intrepretation of the coefficients, a predictive model will be trained.

\section{Introduction} \vspace{.25cm}

\subsection{Background} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
The diabetes is the disease in which the ability of the body to produce and respond
to the hormone insulin is impaired. A number of medical risks are associated with
diabetes and many of them stem from damage to the tiny blood vessels in the eyes,
called Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) [2]. DR is a condition that happens when the high
blood sugar levels cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina that lines the
back of the eye [3]. These blood vessels can swell or close and stopping the blood
from passing through. And in the most advanced stage, the new abnormal blood vessels
grow on the retina, which can lead to a potential of severe vision loss and
blindness to the people with diabetes [4]. The aforementioned features of this
condition show up in fundoscopy images in Figure \ref{fig:retina}.

The number of patients with diabetic retinopathy nowadays increased very rapidly
[4], and the complications associated with the long duration of the disease becomes
one of the challenges that faced the health care system. During the development of
DR, the patients may not notice any changes in their vision, and the DR might be
very advanced by the time that patients have visual complaints and experience visual
loss eventually [5]. So, to detect DR in an early stage, people with diabetes should
get a dilated eye exam at least once a year, thus in case of an early diagnosis, the
progression of DR can be reduced by an appropriate therapy. Thatâ€™s mean the early
detection, timely treatment, and appropriate follow-up care of diabetic eye disease
can protect the people with diabetic against vision loss.

Automatic Computer-Aided diagnosis system of retinal images is an important field
that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images and to easily check the
state of the patient eyes. This type of system uses a wide ranges of data analysis
and machine learning techniques to automatically diagnose the vessels, optic disk,
and bright lesions, as well as to assess the image quality of the eyes [6].

This paper aims to use statistical techniques to understand which features are
related with the response variable (presence or not of signs of DR) and try to
predict these responses.

\subsection{Dataset Description} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
The Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset was taken from the UCI repository website [1].

\subsubsection{Dataset Information} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
This dataset contains features extracted from the Messidor image set and aims to
predict whether a particular image contains signs of diabetic retinopathy or not.
All the variables represent either a detected lesion, a characteristic feature of an
anatomical part or an image-level descriptor.

\subsubsection{Dataset Characteristics} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
The dataset characteristics are shown in Table \ref{tab:data_charac}.

\subsection{Scientific Goals and Primary Questions of Interest} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
The number of patient with DR increased rapidly, and the exact technique by which
diabetes causes this disease remains unclear. In addition to that, DR can develop
without any severe symptoms. Therefore, there is a high need to improve the methods
that can diagnose DR as soon as possible because the early detection and treatment
can reduce the risk of blindness by 95\%[4]. The project will provide a quick way
for an early detection of diabetic retinopathy so the patient can receive an early
treatment that can limit the potential for significant vision loss. 

The principal goal of this study is verifying which variables have a difference
statically significant between the two levels of the response variable, i.e.,
between patients without signs of DR, and with signs of DR. Besides verify which
variables, we aim to quantify and interpret this difference. Another goal of this
study is verifying which variables are statistically significant to predict if the
patient has or hasn't signs of DR.

From the 1151 patients in the study, 611 (\Sexpr{round(611/1151, 2)*100}\%) present
signs of DR. The three categorical features presented in the dataset are shown in
the Figure \ref{fig:cat_var}. Practically all the patients (99.7\%) have a
sufficient quality assessment and more than 90\% present a Severe Retinal
Abnormality (SRA). Given this disproportionality, this two features will not be
used in the statistical analysis. Also in Figure \ref{fig:cat_var} we see that 1/3
of the patients present a positive result AM/FM classification, i.e., using this
instrument 33.6\% of the patients present pathological lesions in the retinal
structures.

In the Figure \ref{fig:big_pairs} are provided 2x2 scatter plots and the
correlations for all the numerical variables. For the MD features we see a clear
linear relationship. The linear relationship looks more stronger for the patients
in blue, without signs of DR. In the left-graph of the Figure \ref{fig:images} we
can see better the correlations between the confidence levels of the MD features.
The detections are correlated in all confidence levels, with a minimum
correlation of 0.86 (between the most far levels). Closer confidence levels are
extremely correlated (superior a 0.95). Thus, we see here a pattern. The further
away the confidence levels, the lower is the correlation.

In the scatter plots for the exudates detection by several sets of points, in Figure
\ref{fig:big_pairs}, a linear relationship is observed only for very close numbers
of the set of points. Conform the difference between this numbers became larger, the
linear behavior disappears, and the correlation goes to less than 0.4 (right-graph
of Figure \ref{fig:images}). We also see in the scatterplots that, in general, exist
much more variability among the values of the patients with signs of DR (in orange).

Comparing the euclidian distance and the diameter features with the others, none
evident stronger relation is observed.

\subsection{Modeling Process \& Methodology} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
Before study the effect of all the variables together with the goal of seeing which
features are significant to explain the signs of DR and to predict this signs, in
the presence of the others, we can look for some of the features individually. To
verify if their means are different from one response group (signs of DR or not) to
the other, we use a \(t\)-test.

The formula of the \(t\) test statistic is described in the equation
\ref{eq:t.test}, with \(W\) being a weight (the sample size of one group divided by
the total sample size) for the sample size and with \(S^{2}\) being the estimated
sample variance among each group.

\begin{align}
\label{eq:t.test}
 t_{\rm est} = \frac{\bar{X}_{\rm No} - \bar{X}_{\rm Yes}}{\sqrt{
                 S_{p}^{2} \cdot
                 \Big(\frac{1}{n_{\rm No}} + \frac{1}{n_{\rm Yes}}\Big)}},
 \quad \text{ where } \quad S_{p}^{2} = W_{\rm No} \cdot S_{\rm No}^{2} +
                                        W_{\rm Yes} \cdot S_{\rm Yes}^{2}.
\end{align}

\noindent
The test statistic \(t_{\rm est}\) follow (\(\sim\)) a \(t\)-distribution with
\(n = n_{\rm No} + n_{\rm Yes}\) degrees of freedom.

To verify the significance of one feature in the presence of others, we choosed to
use the logistic regression model. The logistic regression is the most famous and
used model in medicine and epidemiology, the reason for this is because this 
methodology combines simplicity, power and interpretation. Simplicity because isn't
a very complex model. Powerful because this model is able to provide very good
results in a general way, and their parameter interpretation is given in terms of
odds ratio.

The logistic regression [7] can be understood as finding the values of the \(\beta\)
parameters that best fit:

\begin{align*}
 y = \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{ if } \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x + \varepsilon  > 0 \\
      0 & \text{ if } \text{ otherwise} 
     \end{cases}, \quad \text{ where } \varepsilon
     \text{ is an error distributed by the standard logistic distribution}.
\end{align*}

And the logistic function is defined by:

\[ F(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x)}}. \]

The inverse of the logistic function, \(g\), also called of logit (log odds) is
defined by: 

\[ g(F(x)) = \ln \left(\frac{F(x)}{1-F(x)}\right) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x
  \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{F(x)}{1-F(x)} = e^{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x}.
\]

Where:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \(g\) is the logit function. The equation for \(g(F(x))\) illustrates that
       the logit (i.e., the log-odds) is equivalent to the linear regression
       expression.
 \item \(F(x)\) is the probability that the response variable equals a case, given
       some linear combination of the predictors. This is important in that it shows
       that the value of the linear regression expression can vary from negative to
       positive infinity and yet, after transformation, the resulting expression for
       the probability \(F(x)\) ranges between 0 and 1.
 \item \(\beta_{0}\) is the intercept from the linear regression equation (the value
       of the criterion when the predictor is equal to zero).
 \item \(\beta_{1}x\) is the regression coefficient multiplied by some value of the
       feature.
\end{itemize}

In the context of generalized linear models for binary data, the logit is the
canonical link function and when used the resulting model is called  of logistic
regression. However, other link function can be used [7] and [8]. These link
functions are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Probit or inverse Normal function: \(g(F(x)) = \Phi^{-1}(F(x))\).
 \item Log-log function: \(g(F(x)) = -\log(-\log(F(x)))\).
 \item Complementary log-log function: \(g(F(x)) = \log(-\log(1 - F(x)))\).
 \item Cauchit function: \(\tan\left(\pi F(x) - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\).
\end{itemize}

For estimate the model we use maximum likelihood. To test the significance of the
coefficients we can use likelihood ratio test or the Wald statistic. More details
about this techniques can be seen in [9].

Thinking in the classification, we can separate the data into two parts. One for
training the model and other for test. In general between 60 \(\sim\) 70\% of the
data are separeted for the train, and the rest stays for the test.

To do all the fits and computation we use the R language [10].

\subsection{Diagnosis \& Goodness of Fit} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
Under the null hypothesis that the model fit is satisfactory, to verify the goodness
of fit, we can use statistics that summarise the concordance among the observed
values and the predicted values by the model. In the presence of continuous
features, the most popular statistic is the test of Hosmer and Lemeshow [11] and
[12]. 

Beyond this we can also use the Pearson and Deviance residuals, the sensitivity,
specificity, predict value and the ROC curve [13] and [14].

\section{Results} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
As a first step, we can look marginally for the two continuous variables that arenâ€™t
strictly related to the others. We are talking about the (1) euclidian distance of
the center of the macula to the center of the optic disc and (2) the diameter of the
optic disc. To verify if we have evidence of the difference between the means of
each one of these variables in relation to the presence (or not) of signs of DR we
used a \(t\)-test.

We tested a null hypothesis  \(H_{\rm Null}\) of equality, i.e., that the difference
of the means isn't statistically significant, versus an alternative hypothesis
\(H_{\rm Alt}\) of significant difference. In the Tables \ref{tab:t.test_euc} and
\ref{tab:t.test_diam} we present the results of the \(t\)-test for the two
variables.

 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
We see that for both variables the means are extremely similar in each group
(presence or not of signs of DR), and in consequence, the reference distribution is
bigger than the test statistic in both cases, which means that we don't have enough
evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Thinking in a regression model with several variables, with this result we can
already expect that this two variables, (1) euclidian distance of the center of the
macula and the center to the optic disc and (2) the diameter of the optic disc will
not be significant to separate the patients between the two groups.

In Figure \ref{fig:cat_var} we saw that using the AM/FM classification 1/3 of the
patients present pathological lesions in the retinal structures. In Table
\ref{tab:xtabs_desc} we compare the AM/FM classification of the patients with the
DR classification. Among the patients with no signs of DR,
\Sexpr{round(193/540, 2)*100}\% (193/540) present pathological lesions in the
retinal structures. Among the patients with signs of DR,
\Sexpr{round(417/611, 2)*100}\% present normal retinal structures.

To start, we fitted a logistic regression (logit link function) considering all the
features. With this first model, we can start to do variables (features) selection
using likelihood ratio test. 

Looking now only for this first model we have the Table \ref{tab:sum_m0}. There we
can see in the \(p\)-value column that for the MD features, only the values for the
0.9 confidence level weren't significant, considering a significance level of 10\%.
For the exudates detection features only two was significant, with one and two set
of points.

As we already expected by the results in the Tables \ref{tab:t.test_euc} and
\ref{tab:t.test_diam}, the euclidian distance and the diameter not shown to be
significant. Considering a significance level of 10\%, the AM/FM-based
classification shown to be significant.

To verify the goodness of fit we use the Hosmer and Lemeshow test, that results in a
\(p\)-value of \Sexpr{round(hl$p.value, 5)}. With a \(p\)-value of this magnitude
has no evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the fit of the model is
satisfactory.

The Pearson and the Deviance residuals are presented in the left and the center of
Figure \ref{fig:res}. If the model is well adjusted, it is expected that these
residues follow a standard normal distribution, and in this way that the most of the
observations stay present in the interval -3 and 3. In the right-graph of Figure
\ref{fig:res}, we have the ROC curve. Area Under the Curve (AUC) superior than 0.70
can be interpreted as a good fit for the model.

\section{Conclusion and next steps} \vspace{.25cm}

\noindent
Practically all the patients in the study have a sufficient quality assessment and
present a SRA. The means of the euclidian distance of the center of the macula to
the center of the optic disc are practically the same (without a statistical
difference), independent from if the patient present or not signs of DR. The same
conclusion can be made for the diameter of the optic disc. With the model fitted the
same result is observed. When compared the results of the AM/FM-based classification
with the DR signs status, big differences are observed. To see if this difference is
statistically significant, a \(t\)-test can be performed.

The model fitted with all the variables present a satisfactory goodness-of-fit, with
a specificity (true negative rate) and sensitivity (true positive rate) superior
than 0.70, and with an AUC over 0.80. The estimated cutoff of the probability to
classify the patients in one of the two statuses in very close to 0.5. 

About the features, in general, the features related to the MD results shown to be
more significant. Thinking in the next steps of the analysis, a selection of
variables can be performed, and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be used to
group the MD features in one, and the exudates features in one too. Others link
functions can be also tested and a predictive model based on the best model can also
be trained.
