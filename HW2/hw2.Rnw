\textbf{A politician running for office is interested in estimating the
        proportion among legal residents of the state of California who support
        the DREAMER’s act (which we denote as \(\pi\)). An organization was
        instructed to conduct a poll with the constraint that the estimator should
        be within a tolerance limit of 0.05.} \\
        
\textbf{Suppose that the true population proportion of supporters is
        \(\pi\) = 0.65. The organization is now at a planning stage to determine
        the desired sample size so that there is only a slim chance of 10\% that
        an estimator (sample proportion) falls outside of the designated tolerance
        limit (i.e., it falls outside of 0.60 and 0.70).}

\textbf{Conduct a simulation study to determine if a sample size of n = 200
        respondents will be sufficient to meet the target? As a guide to
        approaching this problem: (i.) simulate at least B = 10.000 samples each
        of size n = 200 from a binomial distribution; (ii.) for each sample record
        the sample proportion; (iii.) determine the proportion (out B = 10.000
        samples) of sample proportion that fall within the designated tolerance
        limit.} \\

\underline{Solution:}

<<>>=
# <code r> ===================================================================== #
## defining some variables
n <- 200 # sample size
B = 1e4 # number of replications
p <- .65 # true proportion
tol <- .05 # tolerance level
in_inter <- numeric(B) # creating empth object of size B

## simulation study code
for (i in 1:B){
  samp <- rbinom(1, n = n, p = p) # simulating samples from a binomal dist.
  prop <- mean(samp) # sample proportion
  abs_samp <- abs(prop - p) # difference to the tolerance level
  in_inter[i] <- ifelse(abs_samp <= tol, "in", "out") # if is in or out
}
# proportion of sample proportion that fall within (or out) the tol. level

\textbf{Exercises on calculating probabilities for the normal distribution. Some
        of these require the use of the standard normal probability table which
        has been uploaded in the subfolder ”Admin” in the class dropbox.}

\subsection*{(a)} \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{(a)}

\textbf{Suppose that the systolic blood pressure (SBP) among white teens follows a
        normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) = 120 units (mm Hg) and standard
        deviation \(\sigma\) = 4 units.} \\

\textbf{(i.) What are the first and third quartile SBP values in this population?}
\\

\underline{Solution:} \\

First quartile: \(Q_{1}\), third quartile: \(Q_{3}\)

\[ Z = \frac{Q_{1} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{Q_{1} - 120}{4}, \quad
   Z = \frac{Q_{3} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{Q_{3} - 120}{4} \]

The \(Z\) value that correspond to 0.25 (first quartile) is -0.67 (using standard
normal probability table), and to 0.75 (third quartile) is 0.67. So,

\begin{minipage}{10cm}
 \[ Q_{1} = Z \cdot \sigma +\mu = -0.67 \cdot 4 + 120, \quad
    Q_{3} = 0.67 \cdot 4 + 120. \]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{6cm}
 \[ \boxed{Q_{1} = \Sexpr{-.67*4 + 120}, \quad Q_{3} = \Sexpr{.67*4 + 120}.} \]
\end{minipage}

\vspace{.6cm}
\textbf{(ii.) What is the 90-th percentile SBP value?} \\

\underline{Solution:} \\

The \(Z\) value that correspond to 0.9 (90-th percentile, \({\rm perc}_{90}\)) is
1.28 (using standard normal probability table). So, \\

\begin{minipage}{10cm}
 \[ 1.28 = \frac{{\rm perc}_{90} - 120}{4}, \quad
    {\rm perc}_{90} = 1.28 \cdot 4 + 120, \]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{5cm}
 \[ \boxed{{\rm perc}_{90} = \Sexpr{1.28*4 + 120}.} \]
\end{minipage}

\vspace{.4cm}
\textbf{(iii.) Use the standard normal table to calculate the proportion of teens
               with SBP between 112 and 126 units.} \\

\underline{Solution:} \\

\(X\) = proportion of teens with some quantite of SBP (in units).

\begin{align*}
 \mathbb{P}(112 \leq X \leq 126) & =
 \mathbb{P}\bigg(\frac{112-120}{4} \leq \frac{X-120}{4} \leq \frac{126-120}{4}
           \bigg) = \mathbb{P}\bigg(-2 \leq Z \leq \frac{3}{2}\bigg) \\
  & =  \mathbb{P}(Z \leq 1.5) - \mathbb{P}(Z \leq -2) = 0.9332 - 0.0228
\end{align*}

\[ \boxed{\mathbb{P}(112 \leq X \leq 126) = \Sexpr{.9332 - .0228}.} \]

\vspace{.45cm}
\textbf{(iv.) A teen was randomly selected from the population. What is the
              probability that this teen has SBP that is greater than 130 units?}
\\

\underline{Solution:}

\[ \mathbb{P}(X > 130) = 1 - \mathbb{P}(X \leq 130) = 1 -
   \mathbb{P}\bigg(\frac{X-120}{4} \leq \frac{130-120}{4}\bigg) = 1 -
   \mathbb{P}(Z \leq 2.5) = 1 - 0.9938
\]

\[ \boxed{\mathbb{P}(X > 130) = \Sexpr{1 - .9938}.} \]

\vspace{.45cm}
\textbf{(v.) An investigator randomly selected 5 teens. What is the probability
             that none of them has SBP tha exceeds 130 units?} \\

\underline{Solution:} \\

\(Y\) = number of teens with SBP that exceeds 130 units.

\begin{minipage}{8cm}
 \[ \mathbb{P}(Y = 0) = \binom{5}{0} \Sexpr{1-.9938}^{0} (1-\Sexpr{1-.9938})^{5},
 \]
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{5cm}
 \[ \boxed{\mathbb{P}(Y = 0) = \Sexpr{dbinom(0, 5, 1-.9938)}.} \]
\end{minipage}

\vspace{.45cm}
\textbf{(vi.) Again on the 5 teens: what is the probability that exactly 1 has SBP
              that exceeds 130 units.} \\

\underline{Solution:}

\begin{minipage}{8cm}
 \[ \mathbb{P}(Y = 1) = \binom{5}{1} \Sexpr{1-.9938}^{1} (1-\Sexpr{1-.9938})^{4},
 \]

\textbf{A graduate program will admit only students who score on the top 90-th
        percentile in an international examination. There is some complication in
        the admissions process because the grading scheme for the examination
        changed in 2016. Prior to 2016, the scores ranged from 0 to 800. From 2016
        onwards the scores were recalibrated so that they range from 0 to 150.
        Suppose that the pre-2016 scores followed a normal distribution with mean
        600 and variance of 50. From 2016 onwards the distribution remained normal
        but the mean is 120 and the variance is 15. One applicant who took the
        test in 2015 scored 700 (out of 800) and another who took the test in 2017
        scored 130 (out of 200). Check if either of these applicants should be
        automatically denied admission based on the examination scores.} \\

\underline{Solution:} \\

We have two Normal's, we can call \(X \sim {\rm N}(600, \sqrt{50})\) and
\(Y \sim {\rm N}(120, \sqrt{15})\). In a Standard Normal, \({\rm N}(0, 1)\), the
Z value that correspond to the 90-th percentile, \({\rm perc}_{90}\), is 1.28. \\

For each Normal distributions the 90-th percentiles are:

\[ {\rm perc}_{90} = 1.28 \cdot \sqrt{50} + 600 = \Sexpr{1.28*sqrt(50)+600}, \quad
   {\rm perc}_{90} = 1.28 \cdot \sqrt{15} + 120 = \Sexpr{1.28*sqrt(15)+120}. \]

\vspace{.3cm}
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
       Based on the examination scores both applications shouldn't be
       automatically denied, because both scores are on the top 90-th percentile
       in the international examination.

\(X\) = number of students with positive view of socialism.

        pressure and coronary heart disease? Can one now claim that elevated
        systolic blood pressure \underline{causes} coronary heart disease?} \\
        
\underline{Solution:} \\

\fbox{\begin{minipage}{15cm}
       Among the participants with high SBP, the proportion of those who also have
       CHD: \\
       CHD/HiSBP = 144/206 = 0.6990291 (70\%).

      \end{minipage}} \\

Does this provide some evidence of a link between elevated systolic blood pressure
and coronary heart disease? Yes. Because in the patients with normal SBP the
proportion with CHD is 22 percent, almost 1/5, while in the patients with high SBP
the proportion with CHD is 70 percent, much higher. \\

Can one now claim that elevated systolic blood pressure causes coronary heart
disease? No. With this descriptive analysis we can see a possible correlation 
between high SBP and CHD, but this not implies in causality. we don't have enough
information to claim this type of result. Correlation is different form causality.

\textbf{Plot the proportion of deaths against dose. Describe the trend: is it
        increasing/ decreasing, is there an asymptote feature?} \\

\underline{Solution:}

<<fig.width=10, fig.height=5, fig.cap="Proportion of deaths against dose.">>=
# <code r> ===================================================================== #
xyplot(ytotal/ntotal ~ dose, type = c("p", "l")
       , pch = 19, lwd = 1.5, xlab = "Dose", ylab = "Proportion of deaths"
       , scales = list(x = list(at = dose))
       , panel = function(...){
         panel.abline(v = dose, h = seq(.2, 1, .2), col = "gray70")
         panel.xyplot(...)})
# </code r> ==================================================================== #

The trend is increasing. For small doses the proportions are very close to zero,
with the biggest doses the proportions are very close to one. With the last dose 
we have a proportion equal to one, the maximum possible. Whats means that with the
biggest dose all the beetles are dead.
